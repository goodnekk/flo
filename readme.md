#Genmaicha
Genmaicha is a language for graphic design.
You can use it to lay out documents and create reactive interfaces for the web.
It is a single language that compiles down to HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
Genmaicha is a language that abstracts over time. This makes programming interactivity and IO easy because it deals with all the noodley event handeling for you, and all you are left with is neat declarative wabi-sabi.
Check out the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) for more information about how it works.
